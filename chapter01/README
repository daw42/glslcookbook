###### RUNNING THE EXAMPLES #########

Each example is broken up into a class that extends Scene.  Each
one should have a class name that begins with "Scene".  There is not
a one-to-one correspondence between recipes and scenes so
you may need to look around a bit to find the example.  To select one
of the scenes, edit the file main.cpp and change
the line that starts with:

scene = new Scene....(...);

with the appropriate scene class.  For example, if I want
to run the SceneBasic_Layout example, I'd use the following:

scene = new SceneBasic_Layout();
